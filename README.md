### Problem Statement
**IDEAL**:\
Personal financial management is important. It allows people to allocate their wealth effectivly. With plans to avoid over-spending, the savings can be used to fulfill long-terms goals like buying a property and for retirement. Also, the money can be used for some urgent needs.\
\
**REALITY**:\
Living in a prosperous and materialistic society, people are not aware of the importance of financial planning. They tend to spend money for their desires rather their needs. Moreover, busy people are not willing to do the time consuming financial planning.\
\
**CONSEQUENCES**:\
With the emergence of cashless payment methods, people are less sensitive to how much they actually have. They will over-spend easily, leading to credit card debts or the depletion of salaries every month. As a result, they have no savings to plan their future.\
\
**PROPOSAL**:\
Create a digital financial management tool to manage expenditures. With simple inputs and automatic calculations, more detailed information can be shown and time is saved.
