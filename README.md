Personal financial management is important. It allows people to allocate their wealth effectivly. With plans to avoid over-spending, the savings can be used to fulfill long-terms goals like buying a property and for retirement. Also, the money can be used for some urgent needs.\
\
**REALITY**:\
Living in a prosperous and materialistic society, people are not aware of the importance of financial planning. They tend to spend money for their desires rather than their actual needs. Moreover, people leading a hectic life may not be able to have a well management of their finance.\
\

With the emergence of cashless payment methods, people are less sensitive to how much their payment. They will overspend easily, resulting in huge credit card debts.Therefore, they seldom think about their future regarding their finance. The consequences are inconceivably severe when someone have little knowlegde about how to manage and invest their hard-earned money.\

Create a digital financial management tool to manage expenditure. People can set up budgets for different kinds of expenditure
